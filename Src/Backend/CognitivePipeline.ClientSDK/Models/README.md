# Client SDK Model

Models will be used from the shared project **Contoso.CognitivePipeline.SharedModels**

You can also use a client generator tools like [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) if you want automatic client SDK update as part of Azure DevOps pipelines.

>***NOTE:*** If an automated generator tools used, I would highly recommend review the initial generated code and update models documentation and swagger generation processes to have the client SDK mapped exactly as you need.
